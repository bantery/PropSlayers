// This exists purely so that PickActor is able to detect certain Doom actors that it normally can't.
// Is this a gross hack? Yes. Can this hurt compatibility? Yep. Possible unexpected issues? You got it!
// If we had access to P_AimLineAttack from ACS/Decorate, or ZScript in general, this wouldn't be necessary...
