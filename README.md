Prop Hunt for Zandronum! ðŸ›¢ ðŸ”«

This project is still heavily WIP, and not suited for normal play yet. We're working on that!

Requires Zandronum 3.1 or later.
Currently only supports Doom II. Support for other games that Zandronum supports is planned.

## Simple installation
1. Click on the green "Code" button, then choose "Download ZIP"
2. Extract "PropSlayers-stable" from the downloaded zip
3. Drag and drop "PropSlayers-stable" to Zandronum executable, or specify the folder in the -file parameter when running Zandronum
4. Enjoy
